# How to install:
Download this and download my fork of the [nearest postal script](https://github.com/Andyyy7666/nearest_postal) then write:

start nearest_postal

start SimpleHUD

in your server.cfg file.

Note: If you're using mumble voip or any other voice chat that you can change the distance then hide that hud and use this if you don't want to then you can disable this.
